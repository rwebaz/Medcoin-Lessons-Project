## August 6th, #2017

Hi! Thx for the hit ... I checked the US TESS system for a match and I see that Medtronic Corp out of Minnesota "world" trademarked the name **Medcoin™** this June of #2017 ( see attached (.png). However, as you can see by the second attached (.png) my trade name at the Az SOS supersedes by about (4) years. As the underlying "copper" colored logo badge is trademarked by the USPTO separately under Class 35 ( Marketing ) and the Benefit Corp has made a decision to operate under this name, established for (4) years here in the State of Arizona, how again do you feel I am at fault to the point I must remove this Facebook page?
